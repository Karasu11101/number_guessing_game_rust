# number_guessing_game_rust
A simple number guessing game written in Rust language

The program uses the following imported dependencies:
rand 0.5.5
colored 2.0.0

and the standard std::io library

The program will generate a random number from 1 to 10 and prompt the user to guess. It will then compare the guess to the generated number and provide feedback to the user about whether the guessed number was smaller or greater than the randomly generated one.
